## Video ( from Chai Aur Code channel ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFDYnd-XPa8&list=PLu71SKxNbfoDqgPchmvIsL4hTnJIrtige&index=11&pp=iAQB


## API:
 - BTW This is my first time using an api, api used in a video was not workig for some reason so i found an api to work with.
 - Link: https://api.currencyapi.com/v3/latest?apikey=cur_live_Z77QH4toHDwj6IMK2KNh750T3FrogGeJtGiXd502&currencies=&base_currency=__${currency}__

#### Also created my first custom hook in react for getting information about currency using api.
#### And also i created my first react component for input area.

#### Learned a lots of things in this project (i didn't do it my self) also this is my first time creating a readme.md file

It really is a great day.............
